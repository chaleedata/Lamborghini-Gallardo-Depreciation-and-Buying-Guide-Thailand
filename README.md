This repository provides an analysis of supercar depreciation, focusing on the Lamborghini Gallardo in Thailand.

## About This Repository
Inspired by the dream of owning a supercar, this project explores why the once-expensive Lamborghini Gallardo (produced from 2004 to 2014) is now available for under 10 million baht in 2024. Is this a rare opportunity or simply an appropriate price for an older model?

This repository serves multiple purposes:
- To analyze the frequency of second-hand Lamborghini Gallardos available in Thailand
- To highlight significant factors to consider when purchasing a second-hand Lamborghini Gallardo
